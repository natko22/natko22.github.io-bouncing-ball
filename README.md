# natko22.github.io-bouncing-ball
This is my first project at Ironhack after one month of lessons.

It is a simple game , with a bouncing ball,mostly inspired by the game i was playing as a kid "Kula World".

 # How to Play:
Using the spacebar as your trusty tool, guide the bouncy ball through an assortment of obstacles, particularly the prickly cacti, while keeping your reflexes razor-sharp. Dodge skillfully to stay in the game, but don't forget the main goal – collecting points!


# Features:

- Intuitive one-key gameplay – click the spacebar to control the ball's direction.
- Challenging obstacles, including spiky cacti, to test your agility and reflexes.
- Collectible cocktails and other captivating items that reward your dexterity with valuable points.
